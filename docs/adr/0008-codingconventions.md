# Coding conventions for the BeiBoot project 

* Status: Accepted

## Context and Problem Statement

In order to maintain a uniform code even with several participants, coding conventions should be established.
 
## Considered Options

* [Javascript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/rules.html)
* [AirBnB Javascript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
* Self written coding conventions

## Decision Outcome

Chosen Option: **Javascript Standard Style with self written additions**
* Template which covers the most important aspects
* Self written additions allows for more customization 
 
### Positive Consequences
* Only small refactoring is need because conventions are following the already used coding style
