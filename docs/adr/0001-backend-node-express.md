# Node.js and Express.js as backend frameworks 

* Status: Accepted

## Context and Problem Statement
Initially, frameworks must be determined for the server-side part of the BeiBoot project.
A general plattform and a web framework should be defined.

## Considered Options

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 13.13.0 – Server-side javascript runtime environment for web-applications
* [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/de/) – Node.js framework for web-applications


## Decision Outcome
Choosen Option: **Node.js** and **Express.js**, because these technologies were already used in past projects

### Positive Consequences
* No further induction required 

### Negative Consequences
* Already known technologies are used, instead of new ones
