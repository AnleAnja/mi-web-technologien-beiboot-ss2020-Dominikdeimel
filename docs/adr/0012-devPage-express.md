# Express as a server-side framework

* Status: Accepted

## Context and Problem Statement
As part of the 6th issue, a front-end development environment on a node basis is to be provided. 
To enable a fast and easy static html serving an additional server-side framework should be implemented. 

## Considered Options

* [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/de/) 
* [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/) 
* [Koa](https://koajs.com/) 

## Decision Outcome
Chosen Option: **Express**

* Already used for the backend-side of the BeiBoot project
* Express already got a Router implemented

### Positive Consequences
* Fast implementation
* No further induction needed because express was already used in the BeiBoot Project

### Negative Consequences
* No new frameworks were tried out
